  %x  - Print the hex value of the argument.
  %s  - The char string at the address passed to it.
  %d  - For our purposes this will just print strings of data for
        incrementing bytes. Should not be used, can create unwanted
        output.
  %u  - For our purposes this will just print strings of data for
        incrementing bytes. This is unsigned as compared to %d
        which is signed. This will drop any negative values that 
        could possibly add a - into the output.
  %n  - Write the number of bytes previously written to the address  
        given.
