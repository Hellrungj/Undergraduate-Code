Obejective:
    This is notes for the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

        Random choices a randomly for the computer and return it 
    Check(user_input, Computer_input)
        Takes the user input and the computer input and check with if statements 
        it check for diffent outcomes and calls 
    Rock
        
    Paper
    
    
    Scissors
    
    Lizard
    
    Spock
    
    Computer_vsUser
        Computer_vsUser asks the user to pick (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock)
         Call random
         it take both random and the users input and calls Check
    User_vsUser

    Promt
        Promt asks the user if the user want to play a with the computer or another user
        if the computer is chossen then Promt call Computer_vsUser
